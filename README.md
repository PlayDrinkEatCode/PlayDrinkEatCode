# Hi there, I am PlayDrinkEatCode! ðŸ‘‹

## Brief introduction

I am a front-end developer from China.

I enjoy writing code, listening to music, and playing games.

I have tried to create music before, but I failed.

## Why this nickname?

Because choosing a name is too difficult for me.

The name I originally planned to choose has already been taken up.

But at that time, I thought of my hobbies.

So I chose this interesting and happy name.
